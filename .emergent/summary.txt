The AI engineer's work started by verifying CRM user permissions, finding the task already completed. The core focus then shifted to implementing an IP-based automatic language and currency detection system with DeepL integration. This involved extensive backend and frontend modifications, including handling API rate limits and correcting i18n inconsistencies, ultimately achieving full site translation. Subsequently, the engineer implemented a comprehensive email system for CRM managers with auto-acknowledgements, debugging a non-delivery issue by suggesting redirection to real email addresses. The most recent work involves setting up a 24/7 brand monitoring agent to ensure no emergent branding is visible and the domain remains www.josmose.com. Throughout, the engineer demonstrated robust debugging, systematically addressing user feedback on incomplete translations and email delivery failures.

<product_requirements>
The product is josmose.com, a multi-currency, multi-language e-commerce site for water purifiers. Initial requirements included automated language/currency detection, a CRM for order/lead/stock management (with color-coded alerts), automated invoices, diverse payment options (Stripe, PayPal), DeepL translation, marketing automation (social media, AI-driven lead management), updated content from , B2B sections, and an installation video. A secure CRM login for Naima (Manager), Aziza (Agent), Antonio (Agent), and Support (Technique) was crucial, with features like ad budget management and Claude integration. Recent expansions included analytics, real-time notifications, smart recommendations, a loyalty program, professional images, and fixing URL inconsistencies. The current phase focuses on refining language detection, integrated CRM email addresses, and a brand monitoring agent.

<current_work>
The CRM user permissions were verified and found to be already correctly configured for Naima, Aziza, and Antonio, all set to the manager role. The primary recent focus was on implementing an automatic language and currency detection system with DeepL integration. This involved:
1.  **DeepL Integration**: Added DeepL API key to backend, installed Python dependencies (, , , ), created  for IP-based detection and DeepL calls, and added translation endpoints to .
2.  **Frontend Internationalization**: Installed React i18n dependencies, created  for configuration and translations,  for UI,  hook, and  component.
3.  **Debugging Language Issues**: Initially, only the header translated, but not the main content. This was fixed by converting hardcoded texts in  (Hero, ProductGrid, Cart components) to use i18n translation keys. A subsequent issue of DeepL rate limits was addressed by implementing a fallback mechanism with predefined translations in . The site now fully translates based on IP detection or manual selection.

Following this, an integrated email system for the CRM was developed:
1.  **Email System**: Backend  was created with endpoints in  for sending/receiving emails and automatic acknowledgments. CRM user emails in  were corrected to .
2.  **Email Interface**: Frontend  and  components were created and integrated into the CRM dashboard in .
A critical bug was reported where external emails to  bounced. It was determined that these addresses are only internal to the app and lack real mail server configuration. The solution proposed is to redirect to existing external email addresses provided by the user.

Most recently, the user requested a **brand monitoring agent**:
1.  **Brand Monitoring Agent**:  and its API endpoints in  have been created.
2.  **Frontend Component**:  has been created, and the integration into  is currently in progress.
