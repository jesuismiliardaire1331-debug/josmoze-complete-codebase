The previous AI engineer successfully brought the josmose.com application from an MVP to a robust, AI-driven CRM system. The work encompassed initial features like internationalization, email, brand monitoring, abandoned carts, and security auditing. A significant focus was on developing sophisticated AI conversational agents (calls/SMS) trained on Schopenhauer's strategies. The engineer debugged Twilio and OpenAI API integrations, handled interactivity, and fixed critical URL redirection issues in SMS and persistent language translation problems. Recent efforts included meticulous deployment planning, involving domain  verification, Namecheap VPS hosting selection, email setup, and repeated attempts to gain SSH/VNC root access to the server, which remained a recurring blocker. Further, a smart ChatBot (Thomas), a Translation Guardian for consistent multi-language support, a  database with GDPR compliance, and an AI-driven Scraper Osmoseurs France agent were implemented. The trajectory ends with the AI about to verify the Scraper agent's UI integration.

<product_requirements>
The josmoze.com platform is an e-commerce site for water purifiers, supporting multi-currency/language (DeepL). Core CRM functionalities include order, lead, stock management, automated invoices, diverse payments, and marketing automation. Essential features included secure CRM login for managers (Naima, Aziza, Antonio), refined language detection, integrated CRM emails, a brand monitoring agent, and an abandoned cart recovery system. A 24/7 Audit and Cybersecurity agent was added for system integrity. The latest critical requirement was advanced AI conversational agents for calls and SMS, trained in persuasion, empathy, and objection handling (Schopenhauer), operating 9h-18h Mon-Fri for customer interaction, and 24/7 for prospecting. KPIs target maximized conversion, revenue, >95% client satisfaction, and <5-minute response time. Recently added features include an intelligent ChatBot, a robust Translation Guardian for site-wide translation, a  database with GDPR compliance, and an AI Scraper Agent to populate this database from French web sources.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of implementing and integrating the Scraper Osmoseurs France agent. This agent is designed to intelligently scrape prospect data from French forums and web pages, adhering to strict GDPR/CNIL compliance.

The work accomplished includes:
1.  **Backend Development:** Creation of  which contains the core logic for web scraping, keyword filtering (e.g., osmoseur, eau calcaire), and writing compliant data (email, name, source URL, keyword intent, city, country, consent status, status, last contacted at, notes) directly into the  MongoDB collection. It also includes logic to exclude generic emails and prevent duplicate entries.
2.  **API Integration:** New API endpoints were added to  to allow the CRM to control the scraper agent (e.g., start/stop scraping, manage allowed domains, check status).
3.  **Frontend Interface:**  was created to provide a dedicated UI within the CRM for the Scraper agent, offering controls and status display.
4.  **CRM Menu Integration:** This new  component was integrated into , adding a Scraper tab to the main CRM navigation, making it accessible to managers.
5.  **Dependencies:** Required Python libraries for scraping (, , ) were installed.
6.  **Testing and Documentation:** API endpoints for the scraper were tested (status, allowed domains), and a user guide () was created.

The current work concluded with the AI preparing to take a screenshot to visually verify that the new Scraper tab and its interface are correctly displayed and integrated within the CRM. This follows extensive work to fix persistent URL display issues (now correctly ), implement an aggressive Translation Guardian for site-wide language consistency, and ensure the Thomas ChatBot is fully functional and responsive in French. The primary remaining external blocker is establishing reliable root access to the Namecheap VPS for the actual production deployment.

<optional_next_step>
Review the screenshot to confirm the Scraper tab is integrated into the CRM, then test the Scraper Agent's functionality via the UI.
