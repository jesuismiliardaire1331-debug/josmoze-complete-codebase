The AI engineer successfully progressed the  application from an MVP state, focusing on internationalization, CRM enhancements, and automated agents. Initially, DeepL integration for IP-based language and currency detection was implemented and debugged, ensuring full site translation. This was followed by a comprehensive CRM email system, addressing delivery issues by proposing external redirection. The engineer then developed and integrated a 24/7 brand monitoring agent, systematically eliminating emergent branding and ensuring the  domain. Subsequently, a robust abandoned cart system was added, making postal addresses mandatory and enabling automatic recovery emails and delivery slip generation. Most recently, a 24/7 Audit and Cybersecurity agent was created and deployed, designed for bug detection, correction, prevention, and countering cyber attacks. Throughout, the engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, addressing critical 401 Unauthorized errors and frontend display issues effectively.

<product_requirements>
The josmose.com platform is an e-commerce site for water purifiers, designed to be multi-currency and multi-language. Core requirements include automatic language/currency detection (DeepL integrated), a CRM for comprehensive management (orders, leads, stock with alerts, automated invoices), diverse payment options, marketing automation (social media, AI-driven lead management), updated content, B2B sections, and an installation video. A secure CRM login for Naima, Aziza, and Antonio (initially different roles, now all managers) was critical. Recent expansions focused on refining language detection, integrated CRM email addresses, and a brand monitoring agent. The application now also includes an abandoned cart recovery system with mandatory address collection and printable delivery slips, and a 24/7 Audit and Cybersecurity agent for system integrity and threat mitigation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully implemented and integrated the **24/7 Security Audit Agent**. This agent, residing in , performs daily system audits at midnight (French time) to detect, correct, and prevent bugs. Crucially, it also acts as a cybersecurity agent, designed to counter potential attacks across the entire system.

On the backend, new API endpoints were added to  to support the security agent's functionalities, and necessary Python dependencies (, , ) were added to . The agent is configured to auto-start with the server, providing continuous monitoring.

On the frontend, a new React component, , was created to provide a dedicated interface within the CRM. This component was integrated into  as a new tab, making the Agent Sécurité accessible. The interface allows for viewing audit statuses, threats, and manual triggers. Backend tests confirmed the agent's functionality, detecting critical threats and ensuring service restarts when needed.

This work followed the successful implementation and bug-fixing of the **Abandoned Cart System**. This system tracks abandoned carts, enforces mandatory postal addresses during checkout (), and sends automated recovery emails. A dedicated frontend component () was added to the CRM, and the backend handles delivery slip generation.

Furthermore, team roles for Naima, Aziza, and Antonio were finalized, with all three now having the manager role, and the frontend  reflects this consolidated management structure.

The next logical step is to follow up on the user's explicit prior commitment to provide real Gmail addresses for external email delivery.
