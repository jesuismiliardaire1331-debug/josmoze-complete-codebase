The previous AI engineer worked on the  e-commerce platform. Initial tasks involved fixing server routing and product/promotion integration. A major hurdle was a  static asset path issue, resolved by modifying . Subsequent critical feedback from the user led to iterative fixes across currency, product prices, images, product detail pages, a recommendation questionnaire, the Thomas Chatbot, cart functionality, and Stripe payment integration. The process was characterized by frequent user feedback highlighting persistent critical issues after reported fixes. The latest state shows the frontend displaying a blank page, attributed to backend  conflicts and resource consumption from  and , which were subsequently disabled. The core problem now is a non-rendering frontend despite previous fixes.

<product_requirements>
The  e-commerce platform sells water purifiers with multi-currency/language support and a CRM. Initial objectives included server routing, payment integration, CRM activation, catalog enrichment, promotions, content strategy, email sequences, and an AI chatbot (Thomas).
Current and critical requirements from user feedback include:
- Change all currency from CAD to EUR.
- Adjust Fontaine à Eau Osmosée BlueMountain price to 549€.
- Fix missing/incorrect product images (using provided PDF for exact visuals).
- Implement a questionnaire pop-up with specific questions for product recommendations (including a new question on shower water).
- Implement detailed product sheets with technical specifications.
- Reprogram Thomas Chatbot for a commercial/benevolent tone, new product knowledge, and direct responses.
- Fix critical bugs related to the questionnaire's auto-popup (single appearance), chatbot's repetitiveness, broken cart functionality, non-clickable product pages, and integrate Stripe test payment.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tackling a critical situation where the application's frontend displayed a completely blank page, rendering it non-functional.
The diagnosis identified:
1.  **Backend  conflicts:** Errors like  were present in the .
2.  **Resource Overconsumption:**  and  were actively logging 625 violations détectées and consuming significant CPU resources, contributing to system instability.
To address this, the AI engineer **temporarily disabled** these problematic background agents:
-   Modified  to set  in its  method (Chat 357).
-   Modified  to set  in its  method (Chat 359).
After restarting all services (code-server: stopped
mongodb: stopped
backend: stopped
backend: started
code-server: started
frontend: started
mongodb: started), the frontend continued to display a **completely blank page** (0 characters of text detected), indicating that the core rendering issue persists despite the attempts to stabilize the backend. The AI engineer's last action was initiating an Urgent Technical Diagnosis for this blank page.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to thoroughly diagnose why the frontend is rendering a blank page by inspecting frontend logs, network requests, and the browser console.
