The AI engineer successfully transitioned the e-commerce application from an MVP to a more comprehensive system. The approach involved iterative development, prioritizing critical bug fixes (CRM.js parsing error, login issues) before implementing major new features. Key architectural decisions included extending the existing FastAPI/React/MongoDB stack with new modules (, ) and updating core files. The engineer effectively integrated stock management, automated invoice generation, and a substantial social media marketing automation system. Challenges included parsing errors in frontend components and authentication issues, which were systematically debugged and resolved. The engineer also focused on user experience by redesigning the CRM dashboard for clarity and adapting content based on . The development process was characterized by clear communication with the user, confirmation of plans, and thorough testing at key milestones, demonstrating an ability to pivot and prioritize based on immediate feedback.

The initial request was for a multi-currency, multi-language e-commerce website for water purifiers (osmoseurs) with automatic language/currency detection. Key features included a CRM for order tracking, abandoned carts, quote requests, new order notifications, stock tracking, and after-sales service. Payment integrations (CB, PayPal, bank transfer, Stripe, installment) and DeepL for translation were specified. The domain is .
Later, the scope expanded to a comprehensive marketing automation system, encompassing automatic social media redirection, automated posting and ad management across Europe, follow-up emails/messages (WhatsApp B2C, SMS/Email B2B), backend lead management with AI agents, and improved site images/explanatory content from a . A B2B section for professional clients with quotes and free consultations was required, along with an installation video. A dedicated CRM interface with login for specific users (Naima, Aziza, Antonio, AI engineer) was requested, including an ad budget, Claude integration for content, and full automation.
The user later refined requirements to include automatic invoice generation with admin copies, order tracking links for customers, a B2B prospecting system via email/LinkedIn for Europe (starting France/Spain) with AI voice calls adapting to client gender/language, and a delivery management system (stock in France, auto-courier dispatch every two days, client choice of delivery method, free delivery for 3+ osmoseurs). Crucially, detailed stock management for the CRM (Red <10, Orange <20, Green >30) and a stock limit√© warning on the public site (<20 units) were added.

<current_work>
The application currently functions as a multi-currency, multi-language e-commerce website for water purifiers, josmose.com, with a robust backend (FastAPI/MongoDB) and an interactive React frontend. All product images and explanatory content have been updated to accurately reflect the . The core e-commerce functionalities (product display, cart, Stripe payments) are operational, now including stock limit√© warnings on products when less than 20 units are available.

A comprehensive CRM system is fully integrated, accessible via a secure login ( or a direct link in the navigation). The CRM dashboard is designed to be simple, colorful, and in French, featuring multiple tabs:
-   **Dashboard** (general KPIs)
-   **Leads** (prospect management)
-   **Orders** (sales tracking)
-   **Stock** (detailed management with color-coded alerts: Red <10, Orange <20, Green >30)
-   **Invoices** (automatic PDF generation upon order confirmation)
-   **Marketing** (social media automation)
-   **Campaigns** (Facebook/Instagram/TikTok ad management).

User roles for the CRM are clearly defined and tested: Antonio (Directeur G√©n√©ral), Aziza (Directrice Adjointe), and Naima (Directrice Commerciale) all have identical, complete  access, while Support has limited  access. Authentication issues (incorrect password hashes) were identified and resolved, ensuring all provided credentials are fully functional.

The social media marketing automation system, integrating with OpenAI for content generation, is in place for Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, aiming for automated ad creation and lead generation. While the backend for stock, invoices, and social media automation is built, the full external integrations (e.g., actual social media API connections, delivery carrier APIs) might require further API keys and detailed setup beyond the current framework.
