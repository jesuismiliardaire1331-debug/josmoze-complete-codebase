The AI engineer successfully progressed the josmose.com application from an MVP to a robust, AI-driven CRM system. Initial work included internationalization, email, brand monitoring, abandoned carts, and security auditing. The primary focus shifted to developing sophisticated AI conversational agents (calls/SMS) trained on Schopenhauer's strategies. This involved extensive debugging of Twilio and OpenAI API integrations, handling interactivity, and fixing critical URL redirection issues in SMS. The engineer also addressed an Acheter button bug and ensured correct product display. The most recent phase involved meticulous deployment planning, including domain name verification, hosting selection (Namecheap VPS Quasar), email setup, and budget finalization, with a persistent effort to gain SSH/VNC access to the new server for the final deployment.

<product_requirements>
The josmose.com platform is an e-commerce site for water purifiers, supporting multi-currency/language (DeepL). Core CRM functionalities include order, lead, stock management, automated invoices, diverse payments, and marketing automation. Essential features included secure CRM login for managers (Naima, Aziza, Antonio), refined language detection, integrated CRM emails, and a brand monitoring agent. An abandoned cart recovery system, requiring postal addresses and generating delivery slips, was implemented. A 24/7 Audit and Cybersecurity agent was added for system integrity. The latest critical requirement was advanced AI conversational agents for calls and SMS, trained in persuasion, empathy, and objection handling (Schopenhauer). These agents operate 9h-18h Mon-Fri for customer interaction, and 24/7 for prospecting. KPIs are maximized conversion, revenue, >95% client satisfaction, and <5-minute response time.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.



-   : Now includes , , , , ,  for live API integration.
-   : Main FastAPI app. Significantly modified to include AI agent endpoints, integrate new services, and auto-start monitoring/security agents. Product prices were directly updated here () based on market analysis (e.g., Osmoseur Principal 479€). Old AI agent names were replaced with new ones (e.g., Socrate -> Thomas).
-   : Core orchestration logic for AI agents. Modified to update agent names.
-   : Contains AI conversational logic. Modified to use direct API keys for OpenAI, compress SMS messages to 160 characters, force URLs for critical intentions, reduce OpenAI temperature, and remove reference to , then re-add it as  was not working. Sophie's call functionality was deactivated. Old AI agent names were replaced with new ones.
-   : Handles incoming SMS for conversational agents. Modified for URL correction.
-   : Manages interactive voice calls. Modified for URL correction and to deactivate Sophie's call option. Old AI agent names were replaced with new ones.
-   : Frontend UI for AI agent management. It displays agent names, which now dynamically reflect the backend's updated names.
-   : Contains product display logic. Debugged for the Acheter button/empty products issue; the problem was identified as products not loading or language detection issues, eventually resolved.
-   : A newly created script used to globally find and replace incorrect domain names (e.g.,  to , then  and back to  due to user clarification).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the final stages of preparing the application for production deployment. This involved an extensive back-and-forth with the user to gather necessary hosting and domain credentials.

The key activities included:
1.  **Domain Name Correction:** A critical and recurring issue was the actual domain name. Initially assumed , then clarified to . Later, based on a Namecheap screenshot, it was momentarily thought to be , leading to system-wide corrections. However, the user re-confirmed it was indeed , requiring another system-wide correction ( was heavily used for these changes).
2.  **Hosting Selection and Setup:** After discussing AWS and DigitalOcean, the user revealed they had existing Namecheap hosting bundled with the domain. The AI engineer guided the user through selecting the optimal Namecheap VPS plan (Quasar for 15€/month), confirming it offered sufficient resources and an excellent price-to-performance ratio, leading to significant budget savings.
3.  **Email Setup:** The user acquired Namecheap's Ultimate Email plan. The AI engineer guided the user to create 5 professional mailboxes: , , , , and .
4.  **Obtaining Server Access:** The final, critical step was to obtain root SSH access to the newly provisioned Namecheap VPS. The AI engineer guided the user through the Namecheap dashboard, identifying the VPS IP address () and then locating the VNC client access.
5.  **Initiating Deployment:** In the absolute last message of the trajectory, the AI engineer provided the VNC password () and instructed the user to log in as  via the HTML5 VNC client, marking the commencement of the full system deployment onto the Namecheap VPS.

The product is now ready for deployment onto the Namecheap VPS, with domain, hosting, and professional emails configured, and all previous bugs (SMS URLs, agent names, product display) addressed. The immediate task is the actual installation of the application on the server.
