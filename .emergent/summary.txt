The AI engineer successfully transitioned the  application from an initial MVP to a more advanced state, with a strong focus on AI-driven CRM enhancements. Key accomplishments include implementing DeepL for internationalization, a robust email system, brand monitoring, abandoned cart recovery, and a 24/7 security audit agent. The most recent and significant development involved building a sophisticated AI agent system, featuring conversational capabilities for calls and SMS, trained on Arthur Schopenhauer's strategies. This process involved extensive debugging, particularly around Twilio and OpenAI API integrations, handling call/SMS interactivity, and ensuring correct website redirection from SMS links. The engineer demonstrated adaptability by addressing user-reported bugs, such as non-interactive responses and broken links, and by providing detailed documentation and reusable system components. The current focus is on optimizing the SMS agent's performance.

<product_requirements>
The josmose.com platform is an e-commerce site specializing in water purifiers, designed for multi-currency and multi-language support. Initial requirements included automatic language/currency detection (using DeepL), a comprehensive CRM for managing orders, leads, stock with alerts, and automated invoices, diverse payment options, marketing automation (social media, AI-driven lead management), updated content, B2B sections, and an installation video. A secure CRM login for Naima, Aziza, and Antonio (all currently managers) was also essential. Recent major expansions focused on refining language detection, integrated CRM email addresses, and a brand monitoring agent. The application further developed an abandoned cart recovery system, requiring mandatory postal addresses during checkout and generating printable delivery slips. A 24/7 Audit and Cybersecurity agent was implemented for system integrity and threat mitigation. The latest, critical requirement involved building advanced, AI-powered conversational agents for calls and SMS, trained in persuasion (Schopenhauer's strategies), empathy, and objection handling. These agents must operate within specific hours (9h-18h Mon-Fri for calls/SMS) for customer interaction, but can conduct prospecting 24/7. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for these agents include maximizing conversion rates, revenue, achieving over 95% client satisfaction, and ensuring a maximum 5-minute response time.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on refining the newly implemented **AI conversational agent system**, specifically addressing critical bugs and optimizing the SMS communication.

The primary work revolved around:
1.  **Debugging SMS and Call Interactivity**: The initial live tests revealed that SMS messages still contained Twilio trial prefixes and were not interactive (user replies resulted in Twilio error messages). Calls were robot-like and non-interactive, hanging up after a generic prompt.
2.  **Implementing Truly Conversational Agents**: To address the above, the AI engineer rebuilt the system to enable natural, interactive conversations via both SMS and calls. This involved creating new backend modules like , , and  to handle dynamic interactions using OpenAI.
3.  **Correcting Website Redirection Links in SMS**: A persistent bug where SMS links redirected to an error page or the wrong URL (e.g., backend URL instead of frontend) was a major focus. Multiple attempts were made to ensure the correct public frontend URL was used for redirection. This issue seemed partially resolved by the end, though the Acheter button/empty products issue (likely related) still persists.
4.  **Agent Naming Convention**: At the user's request, the AI agent names were changed from philosophical ones (Socrate, Aristote) to more common, confidence-inspiring names.
5.  **Live API Integration and Debugging**: The system was configured with the user-provided live Twilio and OpenAI API keys. This process involved debugging initial authentication errors (e.g., incomplete Twilio Account SID) and handling the user's challenges in obtaining a French Twilio number, leading to the temporary use of a Canadian number for testing.
6.  **SMS Optimization Focus**: Most recently, the user explicitly requested to **deactivate the call option for the Sophie agent for the moment and to optimize the SMS functionality to the maximum**. The AI engineer confirmed this, disabled the call option, and initiated the creation of a dedicated test script () to focus solely on perfecting SMS interactions.

The product currently has a foundational AI agent system, integrated into the CRM, with live Twilio and OpenAI capabilities for calls (currently deactivated) and SMS. Critical bugs related to link redirection, SMS interactivity, and call quality were being actively addressed, with the latest focus solely on SMS optimization.

<optional_next_step>
Run the newly created  script to thoroughly test and validate the optimized SMS functionalities as per the user's most recent explicit request.
