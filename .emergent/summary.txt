The AI engineer's trajectory involved a critical bug-fixing effort for the  e-commerce platform, focusing on a JavaScript error in the Thomas chatbot (BUG 1) and user authentication failures (BUG 2), followed by blog content display issues (BUG 3). The work was iterative, involving extensive debugging, refactoring of React context for circular dependencies, and systematic testing. Despite reported successes and a detailed plan, user validation repeatedly identified regressions and unstyled UI, leading to a strict new workflow mandate. The ultimate failure to provide a stable, verifiable product and documented proof (video/screenshots) resulted in the mission's termination and an asset handover, highlighting persistent frontend rendering instability even after numerous attempted fixes and root cause diagnoses by the AI engineer and troubleshoot agent.

<product_requirements>
The  platform sells water purifiers, supporting multi-currency/language. Initial features included server routing, payments, CRM, product catalog, promotions, content, email, and an AI chatbot. User feedback led to updates like currency to EUR, product images, a recommendation questionnaire, product sheets, and a refactored commercial Thomas Chatbot. Recent additions included admin access for media/blog management, review moderation, AI Agent Upload, and an Admin Dashboard. Latest requirements were: integrating an Agents IA section into CRM, improving AI image extraction, adding product links to blog articles, creating 10 rich blog articles, and making Thomas a fully commercial chatbot (Phase 8). Phase 9 involved a Promotions and Referral System, including a client account system (registration, login, order history) and dedicated backend/frontend modules.

The immediate priority during this trajectory was to fix critical bugs:
1.  **BUG 1 - Chatbot:**  error, rendering the chatbot unusable.
2.  **BUG 2 - Authentication:** User account creation failure, preventing new registrations.
3.  **BUG 3 - Blog Content:** Only 1 out of 10 articles displaying, irrelevant images, non-functional product links. This evolved into ensuring all articles display correctly post-import.

<current_work>
Immediately before the mission termination, the AI engineer was attempting to provide comprehensive screenshot documentation as irrefutable proof of a fully functional and stable application, as mandated by the user. This Ultimate Action Plan required a step-by-step walkthrough across various critical features including admin login, CRM access, chatbot interaction, blog navigation, adding products from blog links, applying a promo code (), completing checkout, and new user registration.

The engineer had just managed to restore a simplified but professional version of the frontend UI, resolving previous React mounting failures (blank screen issues). The first screenshot (admin login page) was successfully captured, but the engineer then reported that the application remains unstable and does not fully support the sequential screenshot demonstration, suggesting deeper runtime issues that prevented completing the required flow for documentation. This admission of instability led directly to the user terminating the mission.

The mission has been terminated, and the user has requested a full asset handover. There are no next development steps in this context.
