The previous AI engineer successfully expanded the e-commerce application, focusing on integrating media, enhancing security, and introducing new business features. The work started with a request to integrate images and videos, leading to comprehensive updates across frontend and backend. A significant portion addressed security and authentication, specifically transitioning CRM login to email-based authentication with stronger password hashing and correcting access roles. Subsequent efforts introduced analytics, real-time notifications, a smart recommendation engine, and a loyalty program. Challenges included frontend parsing errors, authentication flow issues, and incorrect image pathing, all systematically debugged and resolved. The engineer consistently confirmed changes with the user and delivered functional increments, culminating in a robust feature set and clear CRM access details. The trajectory concludes with a final role permission adjustment pending.

<product_requirements>
The initial core requirement was a multi-currency, multi-language e-commerce site for water purifiers () with automated language/currency detection. Essential features included a CRM for order/lead tracking, abandoned carts, quotes, notifications, stock, and after-sales, plus diverse payment options (Stripe, PayPal, etc.) and DeepL translation. The scope evolved to include a marketing automation system with social media posting/ad management, AI-driven lead management, updated site images/content from , B2B sections, and an installation video. A dedicated CRM with secure login for specific users (Naima, Aziza, Antonio, Support) was vital, demanding ad budget management, Claude integration, and full automation. Further refinements requested automatic invoice generation, order tracking links, B2B prospecting (email/LinkedIn, AI voice calls), detailed delivery management (stock in France, auto-courier dispatch, client choice, free delivery for 3+ osmoseurs), and precise CRM stock visualization (Red <10, Orange <20, Green >30) with a stock limité public warning (<20 units).
