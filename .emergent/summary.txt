The AI engineer's trajectory involved a sequence of critical bug fixes and feature implementations. Initially, efforts focused on enhancing the Thomas ChatBot and updating the Email Sequencer, integrating new content. A major server routing issue for  and  was resolved after extensive diagnostics confirmed it was an internal Emergent infrastructure problem, not user's Namecheap server. Post-routing fix, the AI began integrating new products and promotion logic, which led to multiple frontend and backend bugs, including product display issues (incorrect counts, unavailability, images) and CRM agent errors. Mock endpoints were created for CRM agents, and product data inconsistencies (ghost products) were painstakingly addressed through database cleanup and code modifications in  and . The most recent critical problem is a frontend rendering failure where the page displays unstyled text, identified as a misconfiguration in the  process, causing static assets to be incorrectly linked with a  prefix.

The  e-commerce platform sells water purifiers, featuring multi-currency/language support and a CRM managing orders, leads, stock, and marketing. Key existing features include secure CRM login, language detection, email, brand monitoring, abandoned cart recovery, and AI conversational agents (Thomas ChatBot, Translation Guardian, GDPR prospect database, AI Scraper). The core development objectives for the AI engineer were:
1.  **Server Routing Correction:** Ensure  and public  routes correctly point to the frontend. (Resolved)
2.  **Payment Flow Finalization:** Integrate Stripe/PayPal SDKs, full payment journey. (Initial backend implemented, but not the current focus).
3.  **CRM Functionality Activation:** Activate Add Prospect and Import CSV modals, fix errors in Surveillance, Audit, Paniers Abandonn√©s (Partially addressed with mock endpoints).
4.  **Catalog Enrichment:** Market analysis for three new pet products (water fountain, carrier bag, food dispenser), defining prices, and creating product pages. (Implemented but faced display bugs).
5.  **Launch Promotion:** Launch Offer (free product for certain osmoseurs) and a **Referral Program** (10% off for referred, 50‚Ç¨ voucher for referrer). (Implemented but faced display bugs).
6.  **Content Strategy:** Create a Blog section with science-backed articles. (Content created, but not yet published/integrated into frontend).
7.  **Email Sequence Updates:** Rewrite three email sequences. (Updated).
8.  **AI Commercial Agent Improvement:** Train the AI agent (Thomas) with new blog content and enable simple actions. (Improved, but chatbot behavior still needs refinement for new products).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical frontend rendering bug where the entire application page would load as unstyled, raw text.

The investigation has pinpointed the root cause: the  process for the frontend application is incorrectly generating static asset (CSS, JavaScript) paths with a  prefix. For instance,  is referenced as  in the build output. This happens despite attempts to configure the public URL to the root by adding  to  and  to .

Because the application is being served from the root path () on Emergent's infrastructure, the browser attempts to fetch these assets from , which results in a 404 error, causing the page to lose all its styling and functionality and display as plain text.

The AI has successfully identified this discrepancy between the intended public path and the actual path embedded in the build, but the configuration attempts to correct it have not yet taken effect. The current task is to definitively resolve this build configuration issue to ensure assets are referenced correctly from the root.

<optional_next_step>
Identify and correct the underlying build configuration that forces  as the public path in the frontend.
