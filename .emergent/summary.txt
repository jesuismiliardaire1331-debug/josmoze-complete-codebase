User feedback led to critical updates: currency change to EUR, professional product image integration from a PDF, a one-time product recommendation questionnaire, detailed product sheets, and a refactored Thomas Chatbot with a benevolent/commercial tone. Key bug fixes included questionnaire auto-popup, chatbot repetitiveness, cart issues, and Stripe integration. Further requirements introduced a full admin access for media uploads, blog management, review moderation, an AI Agent Upload feature to scrape product data from external sites, and an Admin Dashboard.
