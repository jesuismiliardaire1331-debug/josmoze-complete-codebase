The AI engineer's work began by addressing critical infrastructure and application bugs. Initially, server routing for  and  was resolved, followed by product and promotion integration. This led to numerous display issues, CRM agent errors (addressed with mock endpoints), and ghost products fixed via database cleanup and code adjustments. The first major hurdle was a frontend rendering issue where the page displayed unstyled text due to  incorrectly prefixing static asset paths with . This was resolved by modifying  in . However, the user reported persistent issues: incorrect default language (English instead of French), products showing Unavailable, and currency displaying CAD instead of EUR. This was diagnosed as the frontend running in development mode and a backend language detection service using the server's IP (US) instead of forcing French/EUR. The AI engineer corrected the backend translation service to force FR/EUR and temporarily disabled the frontend . The default language and product stock issues are now resolved, but currency and image problems remain.

The  e-commerce platform sells water purifiers with multi-currency/language support and a CRM. Initial development objectives included:
1. Server Routing: Ensure  and  routes work. (Resolved)
2. Payment Flow: Integrate Stripe/PayPal (initial backend).
3. CRM Activation: Activate Add Prospect, Import CSV, fix Surveillance, Audit, Paniers Abandonnés (mock endpoints implemented).
4. Catalog Enrichment: Add three new pet products, define prices, create product pages (implemented, faced display bugs).
5. Launch Promotion: Launch Offer and Referral Program (implemented, faced display bugs).
6. Content Strategy: Blog section (content created).
7. Email Sequence: Rewrite three email sequences (updated).
8. AI Commercial Agent: Train Thomas ChatBot with new content, enable actions (improved, needs refinement).

**Current Requirements (after Phase 1 feedback):**
- **CRITICAL**: Change all currency from CAD to EUR.
- Fontaine à Eau Osmosée BlueMountain price must be 549€.
- Fix missing/incorrect product images.
- Implement questionnaire pop-up for product recommendations.
- Implement detailed product sheets.
- Reprogram Thomas Chatbot for a commercial/benevolent tone.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's feedback from a partially successful Phase 1 validation. The critical issues of frontend styling (unstyled text), default language (English vs. French), and product stock (unavailable vs. in stock) have been resolved.

However, the user reported new critical issues:
1.  **Currency**: All prices display in CAD$ instead of EUR€.
2.  **Specific Product Price**: Fontaine à Eau Osmosée BlueMountain is 479€ instead of the requested 549€.
3.  **Product Images**: Several products have missing images, and Fontaine à Eau pour Animaux AquaPet Premium shows an incorrect image.

The AI engineer's current focus is on **Priority 1: Correcting the currency from CAD to EUR**. The engineer has just started investigating where the CAD currency is defined in the system, specifically looking into the translation service configuration.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and fix where the CAD currency is being defined and used, changing it to EUR.
